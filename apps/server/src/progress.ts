/**
 * Tool-call progress notifications (#279).
 *
 * Three tools fan out over Strava: `get-best-efforts` reads up to 200 activity
 * details, `find-segments-on-route` explores up to a dozen map tiles, and the
 * training-load / fitness-trend feeds page through an athlete's history. Until
 * now every one of them was silent from the first request to the last, so an
 * MCP App showed a bare skeleton for a minute and a host's request timeout had
 * nothing to reset itself against (ext-apps v1.6.0 resets on progress).
 *
 * ## Why the count lives in the message, not in `total`
 *
 * The spec requires `progress` to strictly increase for the lifetime of one
 * progress token. A single call has several phases with different
 * denominators — "page 3 of an unknown number", then "activity 87 of 120" —
 * and one monotonic number cannot honestly carry two of them: continuing the
 * counter across phases overshoots `total`, and restarting it goes backwards.
 * So `progress` is a plain tick counter, `total` is omitted, and the countable
 * detail is written into `message`, which is what an app renders anyway. A
 * client loses a determinate progress bar and gains a line that is true.
 *
 * ## Why the throttle is time-based
 *
 * Progress exists to keep a client's timeout alive and to show liveness, and
 * both are time-shaped concerns — a scan that completes 60 activities in a
 * second needs one notification, not 60. Counting-based throttling (every Nth
 * item) gets this wrong in both directions depending on how fast Strava
 * answers. `important` updates bypass the throttle, because a phase change or
 * a rate-limit abort is news regardless of when the last tick went out.
 *
 * Like telemetry, this must never be able to fail or slow the call it
 * describes: every send is fire-and-forget and every failure is swallowed.
