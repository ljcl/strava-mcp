/**
 * A bounded in-memory cache with per-entry TTL and least-recently-used (LRU)
 * eviction.
 *
 * Strava enforces tight rate limits and many of its resources are effectively
 * immutable once recorded (a completed activity's detail and its data streams
 * never change). Re-fetching them on every tool call burns quota for no benefit
 * — `get-best-efforts` alone fetches full activity detail once per activity (up
 * to 100). This cache lets the HTTP layer (see {@link FetchClient}) serve repeat
 * reads of immutable-ish resources without another round-trip, while bounding
 * memory growth and expiring entries so stale data does not linger forever.
 *
 * Ordering: JS `Map` preserves insertion order, so the first key is the
 * least-recently-used. Reads and writes re-insert the touched key to move it to
 * the most-recently-used end; eviction always drops from the front.
