/**
 * Bounded-concurrency scheduling for the scan-style tools.
 *
 * A scan tool makes one Strava request per activity, so a serial loop over
 * the default 100 activities spends 100 sequential round-trips, while an
 * unbounded `Promise.all` spikes the 15-minute quota faster than the fetch
 * layer's backoff can react.
 *
 * `get-best-efforts`, `get-race-prediction`, and `find-segments-on-route` all
 * want exactly this shape, so it lives here rather than inside any one of
 * them. Do not copy it into a tool: a fix then lands in one copy and leaves
 * the other wrong, and neither knip nor Biome can see a genuinely-imported
 * duplicate.
 *
 * The helper stays a pure scheduling primitive — it knows nothing about
 * Strava. Rate-limit policy (what counts as fatal, what to report) belongs to
 * the calling tool, which injects it via `shouldStop`.
 */

/**
 * Runs `worker` over `items` with at most `concurrency` in flight, stopping
 * early once `shouldStop` reports true.
 *
 * Returns the results of the items that actually completed, **in input
 * order** — an early stop leaves a shorter array, not a reordered or sparse
 * one, so a caller can compare `results.length` against `items.length` to
 * report how many it missed.
