import { HttpError, RateLimitError } from "../fetchClient";

/**
 * The one home for tool-facing error text.
 *
 * `handleApiError` (`stravaClient.ts`) rethrows a 429 as a `RateLimitError`
 * and everything else as `StravaApiError extends HttpError`, precisely so a
 * caller can branch on the type or the status. The catch blocks this replaced
 * string-matched `message` for Strava's not-found phrase or "404" instead,
 * which misread any message that happened to contain those characters, could not
 * tell a 402 from a 404 without a second prefix convention, and let an
 * exhausted quota fall into the generic branch as "An unexpected error
 * occurred". Branch here on the typed error only; never on its message.
 *
 * Imports come from `../fetchClient` only. Tool tests replace `../stravaClient`
 * with bare factory mocks, so anything imported from there would be
 * `undefined` here and `instanceof undefined` throws inside the very catch
 * block meant to report the failure. `StreamsUnavailableError` is deliberately
 * not translated for the same reason, and because every stream tool already
 * treats it as a degrade signal in its own success path: it never reaches a
 * tool's outer catch.
 *
 * This produces the text, not the `{ content, isError }` result, on purpose.
 * A tool's catch block writes that literal itself, as every other branch in
 * the file does: TypeScript widens a handler's inferred return union by
 * giving each fresh object literal its siblings' missing properties as
 * optional `undefined`, which is what lets a test read `result.isError` on
 * the success branch. A named result type in that union gets no such
 * treatment (nor does a literal that spreads one), and every `result.isError`
 * in the tool's tests becomes a type error.
