 * That is accurate and useless: a model copying `3516039180561708486` out of a
 * Strava URL sees a number-shaped id and emits the number branch, the host's
 * `JSON.parse` rounds it to `3516039180561708500` on the way in, and the call
 * fails validation with the true digits already unrecoverable. Neither the
 * branch's `maximum` nor the description reliably steers generation away from
 * the number form.
 *
 * Advertising a single `type: "string"` removes the trap at the source: the
 * only shape a host can generate from the schema is the quoted digit string,
 * which is lossless for every id. The union stays at runtime, so a host that
 * already sends `activity_id: 12345` keeps working.
 *
 * Pass to `z.toJSONSchema(..., { override })`.

/**
 * Tool-input schema for a Strava resource id (activity, segment, effort,
 * athlete, route).
 *
 * Strava ids are 64-bit and both segment-effort and newer route ids already
 * exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 - 1). An id sent as a JSON number can
 * lose precision in the host's JSON round-trip before validation ever sees it,
 * so the digit-string form is the only lossless representation for those — and
 * the only one advertised to hosts (`stravaIdJsonSchemaOverride`).
 *
 * At runtime the schema accepts either form and normalises to a string:
 *
 * - A digit string is always accepted and passes through unchanged — this is
 *   the lossless form and the one hosts are told to send.
 * - A bare number is accepted only when it is a non-negative *safe* integer,
 *   in which case it is coerced to its digit string. Route and activity ids sit
 *   well below 2^53, so this is exactly the everyday case where a host or model
 *   emits `route_id: 12345`; rejecting it outright (the original string-only
 *   behaviour) left callers stuck between "expected string, received number"
 *   and quoting the digits into a non-digit string.
 * - A number that is not a safe integer is rejected. By the time such a value
 *   reaches zod it has already been rounded by the host's `JSON.parse` (e.g.
 *   `3516039180561708486` -> `3516039180561708500`), so accepting it would
 *   silently fetch the wrong resource — or, far more likely, 404. The error
 *   names the rounded value and asks for the original digits as a string,
 *   because that is the only thing the caller can act on.
 *
 * Ids are opaque identifiers, never used numerically, so coercing a safe
 * integer to its string loses nothing. The fetch layer reports ids as exact
 * strings (see `parseJsonWithLargeInts`), so string ids round-trip cleanly.
