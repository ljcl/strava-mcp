 * Read-only tool that calls the Strava API.

 * `destructiveHint: false` is redundant by the letter of the spec — the field
 * is "meaningful only when readOnlyHint == false" — but it is load-bearing in
 * practice. Its documented default is `true`, so a host that buckets
 * tools with `annotations.destructiveHint ?? true` before it looks at
 * `readOnlyHint` files every read tool under write/delete, and write/delete is
 * the category Claude keeps on "Needs approval" no matter how many times the
 * athlete picks "Allow always". Stating it costs one key and removes the
 * ambiguity for any host that reads the fields in that order.
