 * shape production cannot produce — which is how the scan tools' rate-limit
 * abort passed its tests while being dead in the server (the client used to
 * flatten the error into a plain `Error`, so `instanceof RateLimitError` was
 * never true). Building it here keeps the three scan tools testing against one
 * definition of that shape; `stravaClient.retry.test.ts` pins the translation
