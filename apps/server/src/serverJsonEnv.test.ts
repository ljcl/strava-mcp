/**
 * `server.json` is what the MCP registry publishes as the run instructions
 * for the OCI package, so a variable missing from its `environmentVariables`
 * block is invisible to anyone deploying from the registry. `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`
 * was missing for exactly that reason until #336 — the one knob protecting an
 * endpoint carrying the athlete's data and the write tools.
 *
 * This guard (#337) compares the manifest against the variables the server
 * actually reads, in both directions: a read with no manifest entry is a
 * deploy-time knob nobody deploying from the registry can discover, and a
 * manifest entry nothing reads is documentation for a knob that does nothing.
