/**
 * Per-tool-call telemetry.
 *
 * The server ran for months emitting only free-text `console.error`, so there
 * was no way to answer which tool burns the Strava quota, how slow
 * `get-best-efforts` actually is, or how often calls fail. One structured
 * record per call to stderr answers all three, and a rolling in-memory counter
 * backs the authed `/health` view.
 *
 * Deliberately not a metrics library: a single JSON line per call is greppable
 * in `docker compose logs`, which is where this server's operator already is.
