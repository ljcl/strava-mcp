## Architecture invariants

One line each; full rationale in docs/architecture.md. These exist because
breaking them has shipped bugs — do not work around them locally.

- **Dual-era serving shares one factory.** `mcpEndpoint.ts` serves the
  2026-07-28 revision statelessly per request and routes 2025-era clients
  through the SDK's legacy fallback; one `createServer` backs both legs so the
  eras cannot drift. No sessions (`Mcp-Session-Id` is gone; GET/DELETE answer
  405). The endpoint parses every POST body itself with
  `parseJsonWithLargeInts` → SDK `parsedBody`; that seam keeps 64-bit ids
  intact.
- **Rate limits and retries live in `fetchClient.ts`, never per-tool.**
  Parses `X-RateLimit-*`/`Retry-After` into a snapshot; bounded retries honour
  `Retry-After`; transient 5xx/network faults retry GET/HEAD only, never
  writes.
- **Error types survive translation.** `handleApiError` rethrows
  `RateLimitError` intact (context prefixed onto `message`, bare window detail
  kept) and wraps everything else in `StravaApiError extends HttpError`.
  Flattening to plain `Error` silently kills callers' `instanceof`/status
  checks — degrade only on a type or status that is still there.
- **Caching policy lives in `stravaCacheTtl`** (path-keyed TTLs; key is full
  URL, TTL matches query-stripped path). Writes invalidate descendants AND
  ancestors; `skipCache: true` guards append reads; handlers floor
  `after`/`before` bounds to the minute (`quantizedEpochAfter`/`Before`) so a
  pair's two calls share one cache key.
- **Stream reads go through the `stravaClient.ts` wrappers** (shared
  `fetchStreamSet`: shape validation, 401 refresh-retry, structured 429). Only
  genuine 404/empty throws `StreamsUnavailableError` — the one error a caller
  may degrade on. Catching more misreports failures as absences.
- **Derived numbers have exactly one home.** GAP: `hillAnalysis.ts`
  (`gapFactor`, `computeGrades`) — `splitAnalysis.ts` imports, never
  re-derives. Time-free segment/route profiles: `gradientProfile.ts` (+ shared
  prose in `tools/_profileText.ts`). CTL/ATL/TSB and any projection/taper
  math: `fitnessTrend.ts`. Route elevation resolves once via `loadRouteProfile`
  (genuine 404 → GPX `<ele>` fallback). Text tool and app reading different
  copies is the failure mode these prevent.
- **Telemetry:** `dispatchToolCall` emits one JSON line per call; timer starts
  before token resolution (not-connected calls count); a returned `isError`
  counts as an error; `recordToolCall` can never fail the call it describes.
- **Progress:** every handler gets a `ReportProgress` closure (third arg,
  always present). Tick counter without `total` (spec demands monotonic
  increase; multi-phase calls can't carry two denominators); time-based
  throttle with `important: true` bypass; fire-and-forget.
- **Tokens come from `getStravaToken()`**, passed to handlers as argument 2 —
  never read `process.env.STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN` in a tool. `NoTokenError` /
  `TokenRevokedError` map to one not-connected message naming `/auth/start`.
  OAuth POSTs go through `postOAuthToken`, which retries 5xx only — a timeout
  may have rotated the refresh token server-side.
- **Ids go through `stravaIdInput`** (`tools/_ids.ts`). Advertised schema is
  string-only (`stravaIdJsonSchemaOverride`) because ids above 2^53 are
  rounded by hosts' `JSON.parse` unrecoverably; safe-int numbers accepted at
  runtime, normalised to digit strings; handlers pass strings through without
  parsing back.
- **Tools returning data publish `outputSchema` + matching
  `structuredContent`** from `tools/outputs.ts` (schemas grouped, not per
  file). Text tools reuse the apps' mappers rather than re-deriving — e.g.
  `get-activity-zones` calls `mapActivityZones` from `activityZones.ts`. Empty
  results emit a valid payload (`count: 0`). `warnOnSchemaDrift` keeps dev
  honest.
- **Exports choose delivery via `_exportOutput.ts`**: omitting `output` picks
  file when `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` is set, content otherwise. Content mode caps
  bytes and says outright that a truncated GPX will not open.
- **`sportType` is an enum**: `SPORT_TYPES` (`utils/activityWrite.ts`) backs
  both the advertised schema and the runtime check; rejections name the near
  miss (`Weightlifting` → `WeightTraining`).
- **Annotations come from the four `_annotations.ts` constants**, never inline
  objects — they decide whether hosts grant reads durably or re-prompt forever.
  `READ_ONLY` states `destructiveHint: false` explicitly (its documented
  default is `true`). Nothing may set `_meta["anthropic/requiresUserInteraction"]`.
  `server.annotations.test.ts` holds an exhaustive read/write classification
  table — a new tool must be added to it.
- **Tool identity is a published contract.**
  `tool-surface.lock.json` fingerprints `name + annotations + inputSchema +
  outputSchema + _meta`; `toolSurface.test.ts` fails on drift. Regenerate
  deliberately (`UPDATE_TOOL_SURFACE_LOCK=1 bunx vitest run
  src/toolSurface.test.ts`) and say so in the PR — users pay a round of
  re-prompting.
- **Protocol-surface tests go over the wire in both eras**
  (`server.integration.test.ts` under `describe.each(ERAS)` via
  `mcpTestClient.ts`): capabilities, object inputSchemas (no `$ref`), string
  ids, `structuredContent`, `isError` not JSON-RPC errors, app resources,
  prompts. Extend the shared client, never a new bootstrap copy.
- **Tool error text has one home: `toolErrorText` (`tools/_errors.ts`).** It
  branches on `RateLimitError` / `HttpError.status` (404, 402), never on
  message text; every `isError` text starts with `❌`. Catch blocks and the
  dispatcher's final catch call it for the text and write the
  `{ content, isError: true }` literal themselves. Tests reject with the
  `__fixtures__/errors.ts` shapes (`handledRateLimit`, `handledNotFound`,
  `handledSubscriptionRequired`), never a plain `Error("404 Not Found")`.
- **The response cache never shares references and coalesces in-flight
  GETs.** Every value `FetchClient` hands out (hit, populating miss, coalesced
  awaiter) is a `structuredClone`; concurrent identical cacheable GETs share
  one upstream promise (failures never cached, write invalidation drops
  in-flight entries, `skipCache` bypasses both). Never return a cached object
  by reference or add a per-tool in-flight map.
- **Token status is served from memory.** `getTokenStatus` reads
  `cachedTokens` before disk and never caches "no tokens": authed `/health`
  and `/auth/status` polls cost no filesystem read and no repeated "Loaded
  tokens" lines; a `tokens.json` replaced by hand needs a restart, exactly as
  it does for tool calls.
- **Auth pages escape at the sink.** `authRoutes.ts` entity-encodes every
  reflected string inside `errorPage`/`successPage`, never at call sites:
  `/auth/callback` is public and its `error` branch runs before the state
  gate, so a new page helper must escape too.
- **The Bun version has one home: root `packageManager`.** CI reads it via
  `bun-version-file`; `dockerRuntime.test.ts` pins the Dockerfile's
  `FROM oven/bun:<tag>` lines to the same x.y.z, because Dependabot bumps the
  base image but never `packageManager`, and the lockfile must be resolved and
  installed by the same Bun.

## Key Directories

- `apps/server/` — MCP server (tools, auth, token management)
- `apps/storybook/` — Storybook host rendering the UI packages (co-located stories)
- `packages/activity-chart/` — React + Recharts MCP App for interactive activity charts
- `packages/cadence-trends/` — React + Recharts MCP App for cadence trend analysis
- `packages/training-load/` — React + Recharts MCP App for weekly training volume with trend line and injury-risk warnings
- `packages/route-map/` — React MCP App for activity/route GPS maps (MapLibre basemap by default, pure-SVG offline grid fallback; no Recharts)
- `packages/activity-segments/` — React MCP App listing one activity's segment efforts (no Recharts, no MapLibre)
- `packages/compare-activities/` — React + Recharts MCP App overlaying two activities' streams with a delta summary
- `packages/activity-zones/` — React + Recharts MCP App for per-activity HR/power time-in-zone distribution
- `packages/segment-progress/` — React + Recharts MCP App charting the athlete's own effort history on one segment
- `packages/fitness-trend/` — React + Recharts MCP App charting CTL/ATL/TSB with warning bands and a dashed taper plan
- `packages/data/` — Shared pure data utilities (formatting, activity types, smoothing). Formatters live here, once (`formatting.ts`): MCP App packages cannot import each other, so a formatter two apps need has exactly one home; duplicated copies are invisible to knip and Biome. Server-side equivalent: `apps/server/src/formatters.ts`; sport-specific transforms in `utils/running.ts`
- `packages/ui/` — Shared presentational React components (Pill, Tooltip, Legend, SummaryBar, AppShell, CardHeader, EmptyState, ErrorState, LoadingState, Skeleton) plus the app-shell runtime (`AppRoot`, `useServerToolData`, `useServerToolFetcher`, `useModelContextSync`, `useMobileMode`)
- `packages/design-system/` — Shared design tokens, color constants, and Storybook preview
- `packages/vite-config/` — Shared Vite config for MCP App single-file builds
- `packages/tsconfig/` — Shared TypeScript configurations
- `docs/` — Reference documentation ([index](docs/README.md))

## Agent Skills

Project-scoped Agent Skills are vendored under `.agents/skills/` and surfaced to Claude Code via
symlinks in `.claude/skills/`. Externally-sourced skills are tracked in `skills-lock.json` (source
+ content hash); locally-authored skills are not locked.

- `mcp-authoring` — locally-authored, framework-neutral guidance for building and reviewing MCP
  servers and apps (primitives, tool schema design, MCP App UI, OAuth, testing). Use it when
  changing server tools, resources, or the MCP App packages.
- `backlog-sweep` — locally-authored procedure for re-verifying open GitHub issues against the
  current code and fixing drift. Run it after an epic, breaking change, or wide refactor merges,
  or before planning a batch of backlog work.
- `bun` — Bun runtime, package manager, test runner, and bundler usage (well-known source).
- `github-actions-docs` — docs-grounded help for the workflows under `.github/` (GitHub source).

## Styling

- Use CSS Modules (`*.module.css`) for all React component styling — no inline `style={}` for static styles
- Use `data-*` attributes for state-driven variants (e.g. `data-active`, `data-hidden`)
- Keep inline `style` only for truly dynamic values computed at runtime (e.g. per-entry colors from props)
- Recharts component props (`stroke`, `fill`, `strokeWidth`, etc.) are library API and stay as props
- Design tokens come from `packages/design-system` via CSS custom properties (`var(--color-*)`, `var(--font-*)`)
- Spacing: use `var(--space-*)` tokens (`--space-0-5` through `--space-6`, a 4px grid with half-steps) instead of hardcoded px
- Border radius: full-rounded elements use `var(--border-radius-full)`
- Line heights outside the default 1.5: use `var(--line-height-tight)` or `var(--line-height-relaxed)`
- Uppercase label letter spacing: `var(--letter-spacing-wide)`
- Shared Recharts numeric tokens live in `packages/design-system/src/chart-tokens.ts`. Use `getChartTokens(mode)` in any new chart view; per-chart layout margins stay local
- `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT_PX` lives in design-system and is re-exported from `packages/ui`

### Headless primitives (Base UI)

[Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) (`@base-ui/react`, pinned in `packages/ui`) is the headless
primitive of record for any non-trivial interactive control — anything that needs focus
management, positioning, dismissal, or roving tabindex (Select, Menu, Dialog, Popover, Combobox,
Slider, ToggleGroup, etc.). Reach for it before hand-rolling these. Keep all styling in CSS Modules
with `data-*` selectors (Base UI exposes `data-pressed`, `data-disabled`, etc.; you can also keep
passing your own `data-*` where the existing selectors expect them). Use `@base-ui/react`, not the
frozen `@base-ui-components/react`.

Not every component needs a primitive. `Tooltip` (rendered inside Recharts' tooltip, which owns
positioning), `Skeleton`, and `AppShell` are presentational and stay hand-rolled.

Chart accessibility: every Recharts chart sets `accessibilityLayer` (keyboard focus + arrow-key
tooltip stepping) plus `title`/`desc` props rendered as SVG `<title>`/`<desc>`, with narration
built by a unit-tested `a11y.ts` in each MCP App package; this convention owns the
interactive-control migration.

## MCP App essentials

The complete shell/mobile/theming/view-tool guide plus per-app details:
[docs/mcp-apps.md](docs/mcp-apps.md) — read it before adding or substantially changing an app.
Non-negotiables:

- Every app's `main.tsx` is `AppRoot`'s four-branch state machine (connect error → unusable input
  → waiting for input → content) from `packages/ui`; pre-content states render inside the same
  `AppShell` so card chrome is stable from first paint.
- An app with a required id declares `missingArgsMessage`; omitting it strands the app on a
  permanent skeleton calling the server with `id: undefined`.
- Mount fetch: `useServerToolData`. Keyed/on-demand fetches: `useServerToolFetcher` — never a
  hand-rolled effect, never a "cached or in flight" guard (a failed fetch satisfies neither, so
  the effect refetches forever).
- Every app opens with `CardHeader`; no-data renders `EmptyState` (test what the chart actually
  needs, not just row count); layout comes from `mode` via `getChartTokens(mode)`.
- Mobile detection: `useMobileMode(hostCtx)` only. Bias toward mobile — false positives are
  cosmetic, false negatives make charts unreadable.
- New app checklist: an `"./app.html": "./dist/app.html"` entry in the package's `exports`
  (the server resolves resources through it at runtime and throws without one), one
  `APP_RESOURCES` table entry in `server.ts` (drives both resource descriptor and content
  `_meta.ui`), one runner `COPY` line in the Dockerfile (`dockerRuntime.test.ts` enforces
  coverage in both directions), stories with desktop + `claudeIosCard` variants.

docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

## Verification gate

Run before declaring a task complete, opening a PR, or cutting a release — each step is a hard
requirement (details: [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#verification-sweep)):

```bash
bun run check             # fastest local gate; prefer check:affected on a branch
bun run test:stories      # needs Playwright browsers
docker compose build      # when the change affects the container
```

Coverage ratchets auto-tighten: if `test:coverage` rewrites numbers in a vitest.config.ts, commit
that — never hand-edit the threshold values.

Turborepo caches all tasks; Biome and Knip run as root tasks (do NOT move root `lint` under turbo —
infinite loop). Package boundaries are enforced by `turbo boundaries`; CI runs on every PR.
