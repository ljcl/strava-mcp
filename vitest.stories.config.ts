/**
 * Story smoke tests (`bun run test:stories`): every Storybook story renders in
 * real headless Chromium via the Storybook Vitest addon. Per-package unit
 * tests stay as turbo `test` tasks with their own configs; this root config
 * owns only the story project. No setup file is needed — all stories use CSF
 * factories, so each story carries its preview annotations itself.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT named vitest.config.ts: vitest searches parent directories
 * for a config, so a default-named root config would hijack every package's
 * bare `vitest run` (most packages run on defaults with no local config).
 * Only the explicit --config flag in the root test:stories script loads it.
