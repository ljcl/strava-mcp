# MCP App packages

Conventions shared by the nine React MCP App packages
(`packages/{activity-chart,cadence-trends,route-map,activity-segments,training-load,compare-activities,activity-zones,segment-progress,fitness-trend}`),
then per-app details. Read this before adding or substantially changing an app.

## App shell conventions

Every app's `main.tsx` is the same four-branch state machine, so it lives in
`packages/ui` (`AppShell.tsx`) rather than in each app.

- **`AppRoot`** connects to the host and renders: connect error → unusable input
  → waiting for input → content. `children` is a render prop, so it only runs
  once `app` and `toolArgs` are non-null and the content component never
  re-checks them. Each pre-content state renders inside the same `AppShell` as
  the loaded app, so the card chrome is stable from first paint.
- **An app with a required id declares `missingArgsMessage`.** `parseToolInput`
  returning `null` then means "the host spoke and the input is unusable" — an
  `ErrorState` naming the missing id, not an endless skeleton. Omit the message
  only when every argument is optional (cadence-trends, training-load,
  fitness-trend); omitting it on an app that needs an id puts that app on a
  permanent loading skeleton calling the server with `id: undefined`. The
  classification is pure and unit-tested (`classifyToolInput`); the branches
  are storied on `AppRootView`, since a live host is not reachable from
  Storybook.
- **Fetching.** `useServerToolData` is the mount-time single fetch every app
  makes. Anything keyed and on-demand — a stream per selected run — goes
  through `useServerToolFetcher` instead of a hand-rolled effect. Its state
  machine is `KeyedFetchStore`, deliberately outside React so its two rules are
  directly testable: a key is fetched at most once, and only an explicit
  `retry` re-fires a failed one. Do not reintroduce a "cached or in flight"
  guard — a failure satisfies neither, so the effect refetches forever.
- **Every app opens with a `CardHeader`.** In a host transcript the card is
  otherwise detached from the tool call that produced it. Subtitles are built
  by a unit-tested helper next to the app's other pure normalizers
  (`buildSegmentSubtitle` is the pattern).
- **No-data is `EmptyState`, never a bare chart frame.** Test what the chart
  actually needs, not just the row count: an activity whose only stream is time
  parses into points that plot nothing.
- **Layout comes from `mode`.** `getChartTokens(mode)` serves `chartAspect`
  along with the other numeric tokens; per-chart margins stay local.

Every app bundles as a single HTML file via `vite-plugin-singlefile`
(`INPUT=app.html bunx vite build`) and is served as an MCP resource
(`ui://<app>/app.html`). Apps call their `get-…-data` companion tool (app-only
visibility) on mount.

### Chart accessibility

Every Recharts chart sets `accessibilityLayer` (keyboard focus + arrow-key
tooltip stepping) plus `title`/`desc` props rendered as SVG `<title>`/`<desc>`,
with the narration built by a unit-tested `a11y.ts` in each package (mirroring
route-map's `a11yDescription.ts`). Host context sync goes through
`useModelContextSync` (`src/contextSummary.ts`), reporting the view state the
model should know about.

## Targeting mobile

Use `useMobileMode(hostCtx)` from `@strava-mcp/ui`. Do not roll your own
detection. Five signals at a 640px breakpoint, any one triggers mobile:

1. `host.platform === "mobile"` (strongest, rarely populated)
2. `deviceCapabilities.touch && !deviceCapabilities.hover`
3. `containerDimensions.width` or `maxWidth` under the breakpoint
4. Live `window.innerWidth` via `useSyncExternalStore` (the reliable fallback
   on Claude iOS where the first three are empty)
5. UA sniff for iPhone, iPad, Android

640px covers iPhone Pro Max, rotated iPad split view, and narrow desktop side
panels. Bias toward mobile: false-positive mobile on desktop is cosmetic;
false-negative on mobile makes charts unreadable.

Mobile token patterns: views take a `mode: "mobile" | "desktop"` prop and
spread `getChartTokens(mode)` into their local tokens (axis font, stroke
widths, dot scale). Per-chart layout values stay local — narrower chart aspect,
tighter YAxis width, drop axis-label titles and dense overlays on mobile, hide
secondary controls that cost footer width, `Legend size="touch"` for tappable
vertical padding.

Storybook mobile previews use `globals: { viewport: { value: "claudeIosCard" } }`,
`parameters: { layout: "fullscreen" }`, and a `MobileCardShell` decorator —
what renders inside the host iframe, not Storybook's padded canvas.

## Card chrome and theming

MCP Apps own their outer chrome, not the host:

1. Server emits `_meta: { ui: { prefersBorder: false } }` on BOTH the resource
   descriptor AND the content response. Both derive from the `APP_RESOURCES`
   table in `server.ts` via `appResourceMeta`, so a new app is one table entry
   (per-app extras like route-map's `csp` go on the entry's `ui` field).
2. The app wraps content in a card with background, border, border-radius,
   responsive padding: mobile `{ y: 16, x: 14 }`, desktop `{ y: 24, x: 20 }`,
   each plus `safeAreaInsets.*` via `calc()`.
3. Mobile adds outer margin so Claude iOS (which gives the iframe zero
   surrounding padding) does not clip the card border at the iframe edge.
4. Fullscreen: `AppShell` owns the enter/exit toggle; it renders only when the
   app passes its connected `app` AND the host advertises `fullscreen` in
   `availableDisplayModes` — no dead button on hosts without the capability.
5. Width constraint keeps children from forcing the card wider than the iframe:
   `boxSizing: "border-box"`, `width: calc(100% - ${outerMargin * 2}px)`,
   `overflow: hidden`. Without it a too-wide footer forces horizontal scroll
   plus a clipped header. Footer rows use `flex-wrap: wrap`.

Theming flows entirely from the host: `packages/design-system/src/tokens.css`
intentionally has no `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` rule, because
host-injected vars fight partial overrides from a media query on `:root`. Dark
mode on Claude iOS comes from the host sending dark vars. Storybook simulates
dark via the `[data-theme="dark"]` selector on its decorator; a dark story
variant needs only `globals: darkGlobals` (from `@strava-mcp/design-system/preview`),
never a per-story decorator.

New UI sitting on a theme-invariant colour must pair it with the invariant
foreground token (`--color-tier-text`), not a theme-dependent one — otherwise
one theme renders white-on-amber.

## Recharts specifics

- **Tick label margins**: default `bottom: 24` exists because tick labels
  render inside `margin.bottom` (4px tickMargin + 11px font + descender);
  anything under ~16px clips descenders — very visible under the card's
  `overflow: hidden`.
- **Highlight dots**: custom `dot` renderers beat extra `Scatter` series —
  Scatter draws a symbol for every row including nulls, so highlights arrive
  with phantom points attached.
- **Lines between sparse points**: efforts are weeks apart; `type="linear"`
  beats a spline that would invent times between them.
- Shared Recharts numeric tokens live in
  `packages/design-system/src/chart-tokens.ts`; use `getChartTokens(mode)` in
  any new chart view. MapLibre/canvas colours are concrete hex, not CSS vars.

## Headless primitives (Base UI)

[Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) (`@base-ui/react`, pinned in `packages/ui`) is
the headless primitive of record for any non-trivial interactive control —
anything needing focus management, positioning, dismissal, or roving tabindex
(Select, Menu, Dialog, Popover, Combobox, Slider, ToggleGroup). Reach for it
before hand-rolling these. Keep styling in CSS Modules with `data-*` selectors
(Base UI exposes `data-pressed`, `data-disabled`, etc.). Use `@base-ui/react`,
not the frozen `@base-ui-components/react`.

- `Pill` / `PillGroup` and `Legend` / `LegendItem` are built on Base UI
  `Toggle` / `ToggleGroup`: the group provides `role="group"`, arrow-key roving
  focus, one Tab stop; pressed values derive from children props so public APIs
  stay unchanged.
- Not everything needs a primitive: `Tooltip` (inside Recharts' tooltip, which
  owns positioning), `Skeleton`, and `AppShell` are presentational and stay
  hand-rolled.

## View-exposed tools (host-driven views)

`App.registerTool` lets the model drive a rendered view ("show me the climb at
14 km" pans the map instead of describing it). Two SDK constraints collide, and
`packages/ui/src/viewTools.ts` resolves them: registration must happen before
`connect()` (`registerTool` only advertises the capability while `!transport`),
while the state a tool acts on (map viewBox, brush window) only exists after.
So the declaration registers up front against a stable shim in `onAppCreated` —
the one pre-connect seam `useApp` offers — and the component installs the live
implementation with `useViewTool`. A call landing before the view mounts
answers "still loading", not an SDK throw.

**There is deliberately no host-capability gate**: `McpUiHostCapabilities` has
no key meaning "the host calls tools the *app* exposes", a gate could not work
anyway (capabilities arrive after registration must have happened), and none is
needed — registering pre-connect sends nothing, so an unsupporting host sees
one extra key it already ignores.

Schemas come from `optionalObjectSchema` (`packages/ui/src/standardSchema.ts`),
a small Standard Schema rather than a zod dependency in single-file bundles;
take the dependency instead of growing it. Every field is optional because a
view tool is a nudge. View tools carry `readOnlyHint: true` **with
`destructiveHint: false` stated explicitly**. Each tool echoes its effect back
through the existing `useModelContextSync` summary.

## Per-app notes

### Activity Chart

`view-activity-chart` renders an interactive Recharts chart (HR, power, pace,
altitude overlays; cadence and grade where recorded).

- X-axis `Brush` zoom: drag handles to zoom into a window; the window is
  controlled state joined to the memoized chart-tree deps (an uncontrolled
  Brush resets whenever the tree rebuilds), so it survives preset/legend/
  smooth toggles. Brush internals are themed via `:global` selectors in the
  CSS module.
- Lap/segment band labels sit top-left per band; `selectLapLabels`
  (`src/lapLabels.ts`, unit-tested) walks bands against the visible axis window
  and measured plot width, drawing a label only when its text clears the
  previously drawn one — the first of a crowded run wins, the rest drop out.
  Plot width comes from a `ResizeObserver` bucketed to ~24px (floored at a
  mode-based estimate) so minor reflows don't churn the memoized tree.

### Cadence Trends

Four views: Trend timeline, Scatter plot, Pace Zones, Overlay comparison.
Calls `get-cadence-trend-data` on mount and `get-activity-streams-raw` for
per-second overlays on demand through the shared `useServerToolFetcher` (one
keyed fetch per selected run, each with its own loading/error/retry).

Overlay run selection has two entry points sharing `toggleRunSelection` (capped
at 4): clicking Trend/Scatter dots, and `RunSelectList.tsx` — a Base UI
`ToggleGroup` of chips (roving tabindex, one Tab stop, `aria-pressed` per run).
Recharts `Cell` dots carry no tabindex/role/key handling, so the picker is the
accessible alternative rather than fighting SVG focus. Unselected chips disable
at the cap so the limit is legible.

### Route Map

The most complex app; defaults to a MapLibre basemap with a pure-SVG offline
grid fallback (no Recharts). Calls `get-route-map-data` (app-only) with
`activity_id` or `route_id`.

- The server prefers the `latlng` stream over the polyline and returns
  index-aligned metric streams alongside coordinates. Saved routes get
  `distance` + `altitude` from their stored profile via `loadRouteProfile`, so
  elevation colouring works for a route too. Stream-less activities and routes
  with no recoverable profile fall back to the decoded polyline
  (`apps/server/src/polyline.ts`, server-side decode keeping the bundle lean)
  with no streams.
- Projection math (`src/normalize.ts`): fit to bounds with padding, scale
  longitude by `cos(latitude)`, flip latitude so north is up.
- Metric colouring when streams exist (`src/metrics.ts`): binned same-colour
  path runs, gradient legend, pointer/touch scrub (nearest-point crosshair +
  tooltip), linked elevation strip (`src/elevationProfile.ts`) sharing the
  scrub index.
- Zoom/pan via SVG viewBox windowing (`src/panZoom.ts`): wheel+drag desktop,
  pinch+drag mobile, keyboard (focusable region; arrows pan, `+`/`-`/`0`
  zoom/reset) plus always-visible zoom buttons; changes announced via polite
  `aria-live`. Clamped to base frame; marker/stroke sizes counter-scale.
  `touch-action`: `pan-y` at base zoom, `none` once zoomed.
- Annotation layers, each toggleable via the footer legend: lap/km split dots
  (`src/annotations.ts`; km marks thinned 1/2/5… per length), segment-effort
  halo spans (gold PR, light purple top-10), grouped photo pins, caller-pinned
  waypoints. The server resolves anchors to coordinate indices in
  `apps/server/src/mapAnchors.ts` because Strava lap/effort indices reference
  the full-resolution stream, not the downsampled one. A layer whose fetch
  fails costs that layer and nothing else (429 included): `dropOptionalLayer`
  logs the reason and records a `layerWarnings` note on the payload, sibling of
  `waypointWarnings`, both surfaced by `view-route-map`'s text; a rate limit
  quotes `RateLimitError.detail`. Misreporting a failure as an absence is the
  forbidden shape — every cause is named, none swallowed.
- Waypoints: `waypoints` array (`km`, `label`, `kind: fuel|climb|water|custom`)
  anchored by cumulative distance (`resolveWaypoints` in `mapAnchors.ts`;
  recorded distance stream when present, else haversine cumulative distances —
  so saved routes work). Out-of-range waypoints drop into `waypointWarnings`.
  Per-kind coloured diamonds on grid and elevation strip; colored circles on
  the basemap (`WAYPOINT_COLORS` — concrete hex, theme-invariant); counted in
  the a11y narration.
- Screen-reader narration (`src/a11yDescription.ts`): kind, distance, climb,
  loop vs point-to-point, geographic extent, altitude range, colour metric,
  annotation counts — in both views (SVG `<title>`/`<desc>` wiring asserted by
  SSR-markup tests; basemap as visually-hidden text + canvas `aria-label`).
- Segment efforts split presentation from data (`src/segments.ts`): up to 60
  efforts arrive with `distanceMeters`; only PR/top-10 plus the longest few
  earn drawn halos (`selectOutlineSegments`, behind the "Segments" toggle).
  Every effort covering the scrubbed point lists in the one shared scrub
  tooltip regardless (`segmentsAtIndex`, PR-first then most-specific, capped
  3 + "N more").
- Screen-reader narration aside, the basemap (`src/BasemapView.tsx`) is the
  **default view**; a failed style load falls back silently to the offline SVG
  grid (keeping SVG zoom/pan). Track renders as GeoJSON line features reusing
  the same colour binning (`buildColorRuns` in `src/basemapData.ts`). Native
  MapLibre zoom/pan behind `cooperativeGestures`; OSM attribution via control;
  scrub tooltip positioned via `map.project`.

**Basemap tile source and CSP.** The route-map resource declares
`_meta.ui.csp` on **both** descriptor and content response:

```jsonc
{ "ui": { "prefersBorder": false, "csp": {
  "connectDomains": ["https://tiles.openfreemap.org"],
  "resourceDomains": ["https://tiles.openfreemap.org"]
} } }
```

Tile origin is OpenFreeMap's public Liberty instance: $0, no key, no infra, one
CSP origin for style + tiles + glyphs + sprites, stock MapLibre style URL. Its
risk (donation-funded, no SLA) is covered by the offline-grid fallback, with
self-hosting OpenFreeMap or a Protomaps PMTiles extract on R2 as the escape
hatch — those add cost and either another origin or the `pmtiles` protocol
shim, so they wait until the public instance actually degrades. The Claude
host honours the CSP allowlist on desktop/web and iOS.

**MapLibre worker bundling is load-bearing.** maplibre-gl (v6, ESM-only) is
inlined by the single-file build. Its worker is an ES module importing a shared
sibling chunk, which a Blob-spawned worker inside one HTML file could never
resolve, so the `bundledRawWorker` plugin (`packages/vite-config/maplibre-worker.ts`)
serves BasemapView's `maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl-worker.mjs?bundled-raw`
import as that module flattened into one self-contained IIFE by a nested Vite
build; BasemapView hands the string over as a Blob URL via
`maplibregl.setWorkerUrl`. A worker re-bundled as part of the app build loses
its GeoJSON code path once vite-plugin-singlefile flattens the bundle: tiles
render but every GeoJSON overlay (track, markers, halos) throws in the worker
and silently vanishes. The nested build keeps the worker outside the app graph,
entering only as a string literal. The plugin must stay registered wherever
route-map sources are served: route-map's vite.config (build + vitest) and
Storybook's `viteFinal`. Bundle: ~2.12 MB raw (~554 KB gz).

Grid stories pin `basemapEnabled: false` (deterministic offline fallback, no
live tiles) so browser-mode story tests stay hermetic; the Basemap stories
exercise the real default view.

### Activity Segments

Prioritised, scrollable list of one activity's segment efforts (no Recharts,
no MapLibre). Calls `get-activity-segments-data` on mount.

- The server maps the activity's embedded `segment_efforts` (no extra fetch) to
  per-effort rows in `apps/server/src/activitySegments.ts`
  (`mapActivitySegments`), sorted by `start_index`. The Strava segment
  **leaderboard** endpoints are dead at the API level, so the only ranking
  signal is the athlete's own `pr_rank` / `kom_rank` per effort.
- Presentation logic is pure and unit-tested in `src/segments.ts`:
  `selectHighlights` (PR/top-10 first, then rank) pins notable efforts to a
  Highlights group; `runOrder` lists the rest by `start_index`;
  `buildHeatDomain`/`heatColor` colour each row's dot by effort speed
  (percentile-clamped, faster = hotter) using the shared ramp;
  `summaryCounts` feeds the header line.
- Each row is a Base UI `Collapsible`: two-line summary (heat dot, name, time,
  PR gold / top-10 purple badge; pace, distance, grade) expanding to HR,
  cadence (spm/rpm by sport), power (only with `device_watts`), max grade,
  moving time.

### Training Load

Weekly running-volume bars with rolling trend line and injury-risk warning
weeks. Calls `get-training-load-data` with the `days` window (default 84,
max 365).

- Server-side aggregation is pure and unit-tested in
  `apps/server/src/trainingLoad.ts` (`buildTrainingLoadData`): Monday-start
  weekly buckets, gap weeks zero-filled so the timeline stays continuous, a
  centered rolling-average trend, per-week warning flags with reasons. The
  warning rules (`computeWeekWarnings`: >30% week-over-week spike,
  >150%-of-average high week) are shared with the `get-training-load` text
  tool so chart and prose cannot drift.
- `ComposedChart`: weekly distance bars (warning weeks recoloured in the
  danger hue) plus trend `Line`; the shared scrub tooltip lists distance, runs,
  time, elevation, warnings. Footer `Legend` toggles trend line and warning
  highlighting; totals render in the shared `SummaryBar`.

### Compare Activities

Overlays two activities' streams so the user can see WHERE the difference
happened (the text `compare-activities` tool reports aggregates only). Takes
`activity_id_1` + `activity_id_2`; calls `get-activity-streams-raw` once per
activity (TTL-cached server-side) and `get-compare-activities-data` for the
delta summary bar. That tool reuses the text tool's aggregate logic, extracted
as pure `buildComparison` in `apps/server/src/tools/compareActivities.ts`.

- Alignment is pure and unit-tested in `src/align.ts`: both activities
  resample onto one uniform grid over the shared distance or time axis
  (`alignSeries`, linear interpolation, light post-smoothing), so the tooltip
  shows a per-point activity2−activity1 delta and a shorter line simply ends.
  Pace renders as pace (min/km, reversed axis) only when BOTH activities are
  pace sports; mixed pairs fall back to km/h (`paceCategory`).
- One metric at a time (intersection of what both recorded), distance/time
  axis toggle, legend toggles per activity line (blue/orange).
- Delta summary header degrades away if that fetch fails while the overlay
  still renders.

### Activity Zones

One activity's time-in-zone distribution (#34). Calls
`get-activity-zones-data` on mount.

- The server maps the raw `/activities/{id}/zones` response (same fetch behind
  the `get-activity-zones` text tool) to chart-ready sets in
  `apps/server/src/activityZones.ts` (`mapActivityZones`): per-bucket seconds
  and percentages, the `-1` open-ended top bucket normalised to `null`, sets
  without buckets or zero time dropped.
- One `BarChart` per zone set (HR in `--chart-heartrate`, power in
  `--chart-power`, opacity ramp Z1→Zn), pct labels on top, shared tooltip; a
  `PillGroup` switches HR/power when both exist; estimated (non-sensor) power
  sets carry a footnote.
- Pure logic in `src/normalize.ts` (`buildZoneRows`, `intensitySplit` — zones
  1–2 easy / 3 moderate / 4+ hard, `buildSummaryStats`).

### Segment Progress

Effort history on one segment — the progression signal Strava's dead
leaderboard endpoints no longer provide. Calls `get-segment-progress-data` on
mount with `segment_id` and optional `start_date_local`/`end_date_local`.

- The server pairs `get-segment` with `list-segment-efforts` (one page, 200
  max) and maps them in `apps/server/src/segmentProgress.ts`
  (`buildSegmentProgress`): oldest-first, ranked by elapsed time, pace per km,
  run cadence doubled to spm. `summarizeSegmentProgress` derives the summary
  both surfaces render — best/latest/median, gap to best, and chronological
  halves (early vs recent mean time and mean heart rate, from four efforts
  up). Those halves make "same segment time, −8 bpm" legible; the `view-`
  tool's text prints the same numbers so chart and prose cannot drift.
- The segment-efforts endpoint is subscriber-only; the handler turns Strava's
  `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED:` sentinel into a plain-English tool error.
- `ComposedChart`: effort time on a **reversed** left axis (faster sits higher,
  labelled "time (faster ↑)"), average HR dashed on the right axis
  (legend-toggleable, only when some effort recorded it).
- Highlight dots keyed on tier (`--color-tier-pr` gold, `--color-tier-top10`
  purple; no top-3 tier at ≤3 efforts).
- `EffortList.tsx` lists newest-first as Base UI `Collapsible` rows (date,
  badge, time; pace, gap to best, HR — expanding to rank, moving time, max HR,
  cadence, power, parent activity id). The open row reports through
  `useModelContextSync` so the model can name the effort being viewed.

### Fitness Trend

Performance-management chart: fitness, fatigue, form, and where the next few
weeks take them. Calls `get-fitness-trend-data` on mount with `days`,
`projectDays`, optional `targetDate`/`targetTsb`.

- **No new math.** `fitnessTrend.ts` computes series, bands, taper;
  `fitnessTrendApp.ts` (`mapFitnessTrendApp`) only renames to camelCase for the
  wire. The `view-` tool's text prints the same headline numbers and weekly
  loads so chart and prose cannot drift.
- Warning bands are **dated server-side** (`trendBands`), and `computeFlags`
  filters to bands running to today. The app could not derive them itself
  without copying `DEEP_FATIGUE_TSB` and friends across the boundary, and a
  chart shading a different "deep fatigue" than the prose describes is the
  drift the split prevents. An old resolved block still shades; only a current
  one flags.
- `ComposedChart`: fitness `Area` left axis, fatigue line beside it, form
  thinner line on its own right axis with dashed zero line. The forward half
  draws as separate `plan*` series with `strokeDasharray`; handover day carries
  **both** keys, else the dashed line starts a day adrift of the solid one
  (`buildChartRows`).
- Forward half = solved taper when the caller named a target date, else rest
  projection; legend and tooltip say which, because a prescribed number reading
  as recorded is the worst outcome. `TaperPlanList.tsx` prints weeks under the
  chart, hides with the plan toggle.
- One legend toggle **per band kind present** (`countBandKinds`): a window
  routinely carries fatigue and ramp bands at once and reads as one smear
  otherwise.
- Story fixture is **generated** by running real `buildFitnessTrend` over a
  scripted 12-week block — CTL/ATL are recurrences, so a handwritten series
  charts a shape the server can never produce.
