# Operations

Running and operating a deployed instance: configuration, auth flows, health,
tokens, rate limits, and endpoint security. For the code behind these see
[architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | Strava Application Client ID |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | Strava Application Client Secret |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | Yes* | Public URL for OAuth callback (required for web auth) |
| `STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | No | Initial access token (from `bun run setup-auth`) |
| `STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN` | No | Initial refresh token (from `bun run setup-auth`) |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | No | Shared secret; when set, `/mcp` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and `/auth/start`, `/auth/status`, and the authed half of `/health` require it too (header or `?token=`) |
| `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` | No | Absolute path for saving exported files. Unset, the export tools return the document inline instead |
| `TOKEN_DATA_DIR` | No | Override token storage directory (default: `./data`) |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default: `3000`) |

\* Required for Docker/web-based OAuth; not needed with local `bun run setup-auth`.

## Authorization

Web/Docker flow: create a Strava API application
([strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)) with the
"Authorization Callback Domain" set to your public hostname, then visit
`https://your-public-url/auth/start`. Tokens save automatically. Check status
at `/auth/status`. If `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, append `?token=<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`
to both URLs.

Local development flow:

```bash
cd apps/server && bun run setup-auth   # guided OAuth using localhost as redirect URI
```

**Token handling** is automatic: validity checked on startup, refreshed on 401s
during operation, persisted to `data/tokens.json` (survives container
restarts). You authorize once **per scope set** — the refresh token obtains new
access tokens but cannot add scopes that were not granted originally. When a
release adds a tool needing a new scope (e.g. `activity:write`), re-authorize:
local via `setup-auth`, web via `/auth/start`. Both use `approval_prompt=force`
so Strava re-prompts and issues a token carrying the current scope set.
Re-authorize anytime at `/auth/start` if a refresh token was revoked.

## Health check

`GET /health` reports server state without spending a Strava API request —
served entirely from local state, safe to poll. The container's `HEALTHCHECK`
uses it.

Unauthenticated callers get liveness only:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "version": "2.8.0", "uptime_seconds": 5 }
```

With `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `?token=<token>`) —
or on any server with no secret configured — it also reports auth and rate-limit state:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "2.8.0",
  "uptime_seconds": 5,
  "authenticated": false,
  "token_expires_at": null,
  "rate_limit": null
}
```

`rate_limit` is a snapshot from the most recent Strava response, so it stays
`null` until the server has made one. Wiring monitoring: point an uptime check
at the unauthenticated shape; send the secret only when you want token and
quota detail.

## Securing the endpoint

A tunnel makes `/mcp` reachable by anyone who discovers the URL — including
the `update-activity` write tool. Set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to a long random secret
(`openssl rand -hex 32`); the server then requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/mcp` request, returning 401
otherwise. Without it the endpoint stays open and the server logs a startup
warning when `PUBLIC_URL` is configured.

Set it in `.env` (`docker-compose.yml` forwards it automatically), or pass it
through yourself when running the published image without that compose file
(`docker run -e MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=...`).

The secret also gates the OAuth web routes: `/auth/start` and `/auth/status`
require it (in a browser, open `/auth/start?token=<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`), so a
stranger cannot start an authorization flow against your server or read your
athlete id and token expiry. `/auth/callback` stays open for Strava's redirect
but only accepts callbacks carrying the single-use `state` nonce minted by
your own `/auth/start`, so it cannot overwrite your stored tokens with someone
else's account.

## Rate limits and resilience

The HTTP layer handles Strava's limits centrally — passive, nothing to
configure:

- Every response's `X-RateLimit-*` / `X-ReadRateLimit-*` (15-minute and daily
  windows) and `Retry-After` headers are parsed. Strava allows 100
  requests/15 min and 1000/day by default
  ([docs](https://developers.strava.com/docs/rate-limits/)).
- On a rate-limit response the client honours `Retry-After` and retries
  (bounded). When the limit is genuinely exhausted the model gets a structured
  message naming which window is gone and when it resets.
- Transient `5xx` and network faults retry with bounded exponential backoff;
  only idempotent reads are retried, never writes.

Read `rate_limit` from [`/health`](#health-check) to see where you stand — it
reports the snapshot from the most recent Strava response without spending a
request.

## Docker notes

The image is distroless and runs as non-root **UID 65534**. Tokens persist to
the host-mounted `./data`, which must be writable by that UID or token
persistence fails on first run:

```bash
mkdir -p data
sudo chown -R 65534:65534 data
```

Alternatively swap the bind mount for a named volume in `docker-compose.yml`
(e.g. `strava-data:/app/data`); Docker initializes named volumes with correct
ownership.

### Verifying a pulled image

Each published image carries a BuildKit SBOM and SLSA provenance in its index,
plus a Sigstore-backed provenance attestation bound to the release workflow's
identity:

```bash
# Signed provenance — proves which workflow and commit built this image
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/ljcl/strava-mcp:latest --repo ljcl/strava-mcp

# What is inside it
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/ljcl/strava-mcp:latest --format '{{ json .SBOM }}'
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/ljcl/strava-mcp:latest --format '{{ json .Provenance }}'
```

The SBOM feeds vulnerability scanners directly (Trivy, Grype, Docker Scout).
See [releasing.md](releasing.md) for how these attestations are produced.

## Troubleshooting

**AI tool can't reach the server** — MCP requires an HTTPS URL. Use a tunnel
(Tailscale Funnel or Cloudflare Tunnel).

**OAuth callback fails** — Ensure `PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` matches the tunnel URL
exactly, and that the same hostname is the "Authorization Callback Domain" in
your [Strava API settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).

**Token errors or expired tokens** — Check `/health`: `authenticated` and
`token_expires_at` separate an auth problem from a reachability one. Then visit
`/auth/start` to re-authorize. A full re-auth is needed if the refresh token
was revoked.

**Tokens don't survive a container restart** — The `./data` bind mount must be
writable by UID 65534, or use a named volume (see [Docker notes](#docker-notes)).
