# Backlog and issue tracking

Improvements and changes are tracked as GitHub Issues and triaged on the
"strava-mcp backlog" Project board (https://github.com/users/ljcl/projects/1).

- File issues via the templates (Improvement, Bug report); blank issues are
  allowed.
- Labels: `type:*` mirrors Conventional Commit types (feat, fix, perf,
  refactor, docs, test, chore, ci); `area:*` maps to monorepo packages (server,
  mcp-app, data, ui, design-system, ci-release, docker, repo). Bot and
  community labels (dependencies, autorelease:*, good first issue) are managed
  automatically.
- Priority (P1/P2/P3), Effort (S/M/L), and Status live as Project board fields,
  not labels, so triage data is not duplicated across two systems.
- New issues auto-add to the board (Backlog). Link PRs with `closes #N` so a
  merge closes the issue; the PR title is the Conventional Commit that
  release-please turns into a release (see [releasing.md](releasing.md)).
- After an epic, breaking change, or wide refactor merges, run the
  `backlog-sweep` skill: big changes invalidate file/line references,
  dependency notes, and premises in open issues, and a sweep fixes that drift
  while it is still cheap.

## Editing the project board

Board fields (Status, Priority, Effort) are writable by agents. Two paths, by
session type:

**Local sessions** — `gh project` commands; the authenticated gh token has
`project` scope:

```bash
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOABzAhM4BZ7u2 --id <item-id> \
  --field-id <field-id> --single-select-option-id <option-id>
```

Discover item/field/option ids with
`gh project item-list 1 --owner ljcl --format json` and
`gh project field-list 1 --owner ljcl --format json`.

**Cloud and iOS sessions** (no gh, no project scope on the built-in GitHub
credential) — the hosted GitHub MCP server with `GH_MCP_PAT`. The
`github-projects` entry in `.mcp.json` is the working configuration: base
`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` plus an `X-MCP-Toolsets: projects,issues`
header, which serves `projects_list` / `projects_get` / `projects_write`
alongside the issue tools and none of the PR/actions ones. The path-scoped
`/mcp/x/projects` endpoint serves the same projects trio
(`/x/projects/readonly` for the read-only pair) if a session needs projects
without issues. Watch for: the base endpoint initializes fine whatever the
header says, so a toolset that failed to load does not announce itself — check
the advertised tool names, not the handshake. Issue filing and edits go through
the ordinary `issue_write` / `search_issues` tools.

If the `github-projects` entry is not connected, drive the endpoint directly
over JSON-RPC with curl: POST `initialize`, capture the `Mcp-Session-Id`
**response header**, POST the `notifications/initialized` notification, then
POST `tools/call`. Every later request must carry that session header.
Responses come back as SSE, so parse the `data:` line rather than the whole
body. A CONNECT-level 403 to `api.githubcopilot.com` is not necessarily a
standing policy denial — the proxy reports "policy denial **or** upstream
failure" for both, so retry once before concluding the host is blocked.

Hosted-build notes: `field_names` **is** deployed — pass
`["Status","Priority","Effort"]` to `list_project_items` / `get_project_item`
instead of numeric ids. `projects_write.update_project_item` takes one field
per call via `updated_field`, accepts the by-name shape
(`{"name":"Priority","value":"P1"}` — option *name*, not option id), and
resolves the target from `item_owner` + `item_repo` + `issue_number`, so item
ids are no longer needed. Ids stay discoverable via `list_project_fields`.

## Reading issue bodies before rewriting them

`issue_read` and `list_issues` return issue bodies through a sanitizer that
strips anything shaped like an HTML tag. `Promise<string>` comes back as
`Promise`, and a body containing an unclosed-looking construct can lose
everything after it. Round-tripping a body read that way silently destroys
content.

`search_issues` returns bodies **unsanitized**. Use it as the source whenever a
body is going to be written back — appending a triage footer, editing an
approach section, any `issue_write` update. Verifying by reading back afterwards
does not catch this: both sides pass through the same sanitizer, so a damaged
body compares equal to itself.
