 * controlled by *indices*, so the whole job is turning a value range on the
 * axis into the index range that covers it.
 *
 * Kept pure and separate from the component for the usual reason: the
 * off-by-one at the ends is the part worth testing, and it is invisible inside

 * reason to show the finish. A window that overhangs one end is clamped,
 * since "the last 2 km" of a 1.5 km run is a loose but reasonable ask.
 *
 * Gaps are tolerated (`undefined` values, e.g. a distance stream that starts
 * late) by skipping them rather than treating them as zero, which would drag
 * the window back to the start of the activity.
