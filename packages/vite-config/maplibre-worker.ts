/**
 * Serves `<specifier>?bundled-raw` as a string of that module bundled into a
 * single self-contained script (IIFE, dynamic imports inlined, minified).
 *
 * Exists for maplibre-gl v6, which ships its worker as an ES module importing
 * a shared sibling chunk (`maplibre-gl-worker.mjs` → `maplibre-gl-shared.mjs`).
 * The route-map MCP App must hand MapLibre a worker it can spawn from a Blob
 * URL — inside a single-file HTML bundle there is no sibling file to resolve
 * against, so the import graph has to be flattened into one script first.
 * v5's pre-built CSP worker did that for us; v6 dropped it, so this plugin
 * does the flattening at build time via a nested Vite build.
 *
 * The specifier is resolved against the *importer* (route-map's sources), not
 * this package — maplibre-gl is route-map's dependency, invisible from here.
