 *
 * `isError` is checked first and its text surfaced verbatim, because that is
 * where every failure the athlete can act on lives: `dispatchToolCall` answers
 * prose for a rejected argument, for a revoked token (naming `/auth/start`),
 * and as `Tool error: <message>` for a thrown handler — which is how a
 * non-subscriber gets told segment effort history needs a subscription. None
 * of it is JSON, so parsing first reported every one of them as a malformed
 * response and threw the only useful sentence away.
