 * Key for a continuous colour ramp: a gradient bar between its two endpoint
 * values (#254).
 *
 * Extracted from route-map's metric scale when activity-segments needed the
 * same thing — it colours every row's dot with the identical shared ramp and
 * rendered no key at all, so the app's primary visual encoding could not be
 * interpreted: nothing said whether green meant fast or slow.
 *
 * The gradient arrives as a prop rather than imported, so this stays a purely
 * presentational component and `packages/ui` needs no data dependency.
