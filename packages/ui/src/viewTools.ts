/**
 * View-exposed tools: letting the model drive a rendered view.
 *
 * Today an app only pushes state *out* (`useModelContextSync`). ext-apps
 * v1.7 added `App.registerTool`, which makes it two-way: when the user asks
 * about the climb at 14 km, the model can pan the map there.
 *
 * ## Why a registry instead of registering from the component
 *
 * Two constraints in the SDK collide, and this module exists to resolve them.
 *
 * 1. **Registration must happen before `connect()`.** `registerTool` calls
 *    `registerCapabilities({tools:…})` only while `!this.transport`, and
 *    `registerCapabilities` throws outright once a transport exists. A tool
 *    registered after the handshake is never advertised in `ui/initialize`,
 *    and installing the `tools/list` handler without the capability throws
 *    "Client does not support tool capability".
 * 2. **The state a tool acts on does not exist until after `connect()`.** The
 *    map's viewBox and the chart's brush window live in the content component,
 *    which `AppRoot` only renders once `app` and `toolArgs` are non-null.
 *
 * So the declaration (name, description, schema) is registered up front against
 * a stable shim, and the component installs the live implementation when it
 * mounts. A call that lands before an implementation is installed reports that
 * the view is still loading rather than throwing an opaque SDK error.
 *
 * ## Why there is no host-capability gate
 *
 * The issue that asked for this assumed one. There isn't one to use:
 * `McpUiHostCapabilities` has `serverTools` (the host will proxy calls *to the
 * MCP server*), `updateModelContext`, `message`, `sampling` — and nothing that
 * says the host will call tools the *app* exposes. Nor could a gate work if it
 * existed, since host capabilities are only known after `connect()` and
 * registration has to precede it.
 *
 * A gate is unnecessary anyway. Registering before connect sends nothing: the
 * `sendToolListChanged` inside `registerTool` is suppressed while the
 * handshake has not completed, so all that reaches an unsupporting host is one
 * extra key in the `ui/initialize` capabilities it already ignores. It then
 * never sends `tools/list` or `tools/call`, and the app behaves exactly as
 * before. The no-op is structural rather than conditional.
